Task 02: Guessing Game

Technology Used: C++ Programming

Concepts Used: C Standard Library Header, C Time Header, if-else statement, do-while loop, etc.

Details: I included cstdlib header to use rand function to generate random numbers and used ctime header to generate the current time so that I can link the generated random number with the current time. Then I used a do-while loop to ask the user to enter their guessed number until the user guessed it correctly.

What did I learn from this?

What is the use of C Standard Library Header.
What is the use of C Time Header.
How to generate a random number.
When we use do-while loop.
